# GtkGLExtSharp
Pick up from old version and I have replaced to new one for GtkSharp 2.12.x

# Change and Update:
Removed ATI related method ( No longer support for AMDGPU )
Replaced 2 libs into one lib GdkGL and GtkGL into GtkGLExit
Added config dllmap with libgtkglext and libgdkglext

# Note for Windows 10
If you use Windows 10 then you need find and download from GtkGLExt github or Sourceforce.net

Sorry I don't care for Windows 10.

It works finer under Ubuntu 18.04 with Latest Mono Runtime 6.x and Dotnet 3 / 5 too.
